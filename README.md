# -Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on patient clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using classification algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project to classify chronic kidney disease (CKD) using patient data. It includes a dataset (`kidney_disease.csv`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`chronic_class.ipynb`) that performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## üìÅ Files

- `kidney_disease.csv` ‚Äî Dataset containing patient health information.
- `chronic_class.ipynb` ‚Äî Jupyter Notebook with classification workflow for CKD.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease based on clinical parameters.
- Explore the dataset and handle missing data.
- Build classification models and evaluate their performance.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for classification models)

## üöÄ Getting Started


3. Run the cells to see the analysis and model performance.

## üìä Workflow Summary

- **Data Loading**: Read and inspect the `kidney_disease.csv` dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and categorical conversions.
- **EDA**: Understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Use classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).
- **Evaluation**: Check accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
